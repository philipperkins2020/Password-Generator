# Password-Generator

## Description 

In this assinment I created a Password Generator using Javascript. The criteria for the password generator assignment was for the dom to produce a random password in the text box when you click Generate Password. There was a length criteria of 8-128 characters for the password in a prompt for the user. There was also the option to select if the user would like to use special characters, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numeric characters, and the user must select one of the mentioned criteria.
